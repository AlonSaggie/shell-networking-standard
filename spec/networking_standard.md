### Introduction
The Networking Shell Standard is a project used to define a standard for all networking Shells (L2 and L3) that integrate with CloudShell.

The standard defines the Shellâ€™s data model, commands and a set of guidelines that should be followed in networking Shells development and customization.

A guide on how to customize a Networking Shell according to the standard can be found here.
